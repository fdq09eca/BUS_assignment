# BUS Assignment

This document is the plan the complete BUS assignment part B.

## Introduction

The following are the direct qoute from assignment instruction.

Software Design with UML(Unit 3):
Use UML to document the analysis and design of your system to a professional level.

1. Provide a comprehensive **Use Case diagram** for your system clearly indicating the actors involved.
   - Make sure you use stereotypes such as <<extend>> and <<include>>.
2. Choose **TWO non-trivial** use cases from your Use Case Diagram described in B1. Document their corresponding actors.
   - Provide meaningful documentation for the chosen two Use Cases using *pre/post conditions*, *flow of events*. (2 Points)
3. Describe **TWO non-trivial** scenarios for each of your chosen use cases. (2 points)
4. Provide an **Activity Diagram** for only for ONE non-trivial scenario of interest. Make sure you use *forks*, *4 swim lanes*, and *conditions*. (1 point)
5. Perform **Class Analysis**: (2 point)
   - Perform **noun-verb analysis** over your specification: Identify the potential classes and potential operations for these classes using what discussed in Lectures. Derive your CRC (i.e., Class, Responsibility, and collaborators)
   - Produce a **First-Cut Class diagram** to combine the consolidated results of using the above two techniques â€“ i.e., noun-verb analysis and responsibility-driven analysis.
   - Detail your **Class Diagram**. This should provide details on attributes, operations, relationships, visibility, multiplicity, etc) (refer to the class notes).
6. Provide an Object Diagram for ONE non-trivial scenario of interest. (1 point)

7. Provide **TWO Sequence Diagrams**, each describing a non-trivial scenario of interest. Make sure you use *guards*, *envelopes*, etc. State any assumption you make. (2 points)
8. Provide **TWO State Diagrams**, each describing non-trivial scenarios of interest. Make sure you use *guards*, *envelopes*, *parallel states* etc. State any assumption you make. (2 points)

For the above questions that require modelling a non-trivial scenarios, you may model the non-trivial ones that were documented as part of the Use Case modelling and scenarios generation exercise as this can simplify your work. Please ensure consistency with your description as much as possible.
